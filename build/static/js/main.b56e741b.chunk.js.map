From that period on, India functioned as a virtually self-contained political and cultural arena, which gave rise to a distinctive tradition that was associated primarily with Hinduism, the roots of which can largely be traced to the Indus civilization. Other religions, notably Buddhism and Jainism, originated in India—though their presence there is now quite small—and throughout the centuries residents of the subcontinent developed a rich intellectual life in such fields as mathematics, astronomy, architecture, literature, music, and the fine arts.</p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n \nexport default Home;","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\n \nclass Stuff extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <h2>STUFF</h2>\n        <p>10 Awesome Things that India is Famous For</p>\n        <ol>\n          <li>Its diverse culture.

With the aid of an Indian merchant he met there, he then set off across the Indian Ocean. The Portuguese explorer was not greeted warmly by the Muslim merchants of Calicut, and in 1499 he had to fight his way out of the harbor on his return trip home. In 1502, he led a squadron of ships to Calicut to avenge the massacre of Portuguese explorers there and succeeded in subduing the inhabitants.
